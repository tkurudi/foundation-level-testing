Having testers involved in requirements reviews or user story refinement could detect defects in
these work products. The identification and removal of requirements defects reduces the risk of
incorrect or untestable functionality being developed.
 Having testers work closely with system designers while the system is being designed can
increase each party’s understanding of the design and how to test it. This increased
understanding can reduce the risk of fundamental design defects and enable tests to be identified
at an early stage.
 Having testers work closely with developers while the code is under development can increase
each party’s understanding of the code and how to test it. This increased understanding can
reduce the risk of defects within the code and the tests.
 Having testers verify and validate the software prior to release can detect failures that might
otherwise have been missed, and support the process of removing the defects that caused the
failures (i.e., debugging). This increases the likelihood that the software meets stakeholder needs
and satisfies requirements.




Errors may occur for many reasons, such as:
 Time pressure
 Human fallibility
 Inexperienced or insufficiently skilled project participants
 Miscommunication between project participants, including miscommunication about requirements
and design
 Complexity of the code, design, architecture, the underlying problem to be solved, and/or the
technologies used
 Misunderstandings about intra-system and inter-system interfaces, especially when such intrasystem and inter-system interactions are large in number
 New, unfamiliar technologies
In addition to failures caused due to defects in the code, failures can also be caused by environmental
conditions. For example, radiation, electromagnetic fields, and pollution can cause defects in firmware or
influence the execution of software by changing hardware conditions.
